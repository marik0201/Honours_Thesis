Within this repository are files containing code that was used to carry out my Honours thesis project.

There are two files, "API" and "hmmsearch".

* API was used to form the protein sequence database to be used in the HMM analysis.

* hmmsearch_parsing is the code used to parse the output of the HMM analysis.
This was done to isolate relevant values and extract meaningful information about the target sequences.
